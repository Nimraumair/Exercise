  HR activities in organizations are facing some challenges in practice, such as occupational shifts; quality of available workforce;
  <br/> growth in casual workers; technological shifts; gender diversity; racial/ethnic diversity; age limit; globalization and organizational 
 <br/>  restructuring. However, challenges facing HRM are seen from two perspectives; internal and external and could be classified into three
  <ul>
  <li>organizational challenges these are internal in nature and often results from environmental forces that are external by nature. </li>
  <li> environmental challenges they are issues emanating from the external context</li>
  <li> individual challenges are the issues regarding employees, how they are being treated, </li>
  </ul>
  Lazarova (2006) argued that IHRM is the process of managing the workforce with additional responsibility to what are obtainable
   at the domestic level.

<li>
HR activities involved HR planning, staffing, performance management, training and development.

  Analyzing the grid, Storey regarded <span style="color: rgb(32, 32, 236);">HR practitioners </span> who are in the advisor category as those who concentrate on
   issues that are strategic;<br/> however, they do not implement the activities recommended. Below advisor in the grid is Handmaidens, t
   hese are HR practitioners who contribute little to<br/> the implementing policy but operate at a tactical level, regarding administration, 
   recruitment, provision of welfare, training and development.</p>
  <p>
    The last in the grid is the referred to as<b> change makers</b> these are HR practitioners that are both strategic and <br/> interventionary,
     who are less concerned with administrative policies and more concerned with the management of people in their organisations. 
  </p>
   <p>
    Change makers assess organisation’s needs, come up with strategies, reach conclusions and drive required changes to completion.
     Change making is regarded as the major and essential role for efficient and effective HR practitioners.

  There are significant business advantages for MNCs using ethnocentric staffing approach among which includes:
  <ul>
<li>It maintains good communication with the headquarters</li>
<li>PCNs ensure that subsidiary complies with the company policies and practices</li>
  <li>The capacity of the PCNs is known before being transferred to the subsidiary </li>
  <li>There is a degree of trust that the PCNs will ‘do the right thing’ </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Polycentric approach is said to be the opposite of ethnocentric, approach,<br/> because it is
    orientated from the host country. With this approach, each subsidiary is regarded as an autonomy,
